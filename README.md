# UoW-Sols-Poodle
Script for scraping UoW SOLS Moodle to find assignments and quizzes.  
Written in Python 3, outputs the data into a CSV file for now.  
This script is not sanctioned by either the University of Wollongong or the Singapore Institute of Management.

Also, I thought it would be pretty cool.
