# UoW-Sols-Poodle
This script scrapes the UoW SOLS Moodle to find assignments and quizzes.  
Written in Python 3, outputs the data into a CSV file for now.  
This script is not sanctioned by either the University of Wollongong or the Singapore Institute of Management.

### Assurance:
Rest assured, your UoW credentials are not stored upon input.

### Prerequisites:
* Python 3 (I mean who the fuck doesn't have python these days)  
* Safari is used as the preferred browser for selenium.  
If you don't want to use Safari as the webdriver for selenium,  
you have to change the webdriver in the source code manually yourself.

## Purpose
I wanted to learn Selenium and BeautifulSoup.  
Also, I thought it would be pretty cool.

## Licensing
The script is licensed under the MIT License.

## Special Thanks
Authors of all libraries / modules used in the development of this script, in no particular order:
* BeautifulSoup - HTML parsing.
* Selenium - Browser interaction.
